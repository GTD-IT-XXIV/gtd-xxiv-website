        Get Together Day (GTD) is a PINTU initiative made to welcome incoming
        freshman students from Indonesia. It is a non-profit annual orientation
        camp designed to introduce them to the warm, welcoming, and friendly
        atmosphere of our community. We aim to ease their transition to living
        in Singapore and its wonderful culture, as well as forge new bonds among
        both the freshman and senior students.

        The Get Together Day is a 4-day event to welcome new Indonesian
        university students. It is held annually before the start of the
        academic year in early to mid August. First established in 1999, the Get
        Together Day is an event in which most Indonesian students are gathered
        to have fun and play games before the new semester comes about. There is
        an estimate of 120 committee members in attendance each year, with the
        addition of approximately 100 incoming freshmen.
